## Eugene Schwartz: Awareness Stages â Copy Strategy

The single most important concept for writing stage-matched copy in AgencyZoom. Every prospect is at one of five awareness levels, and your copy must match where they ARE, not where you want them to be.

### Stage 1: Unaware
They don't know they have a problem.

**Where in AgencyZoom**: Not yet in your pipeline. This is content marketing / social media territory.
**Copy approach**: Lead with a story or surprising fact that reveals the problem.
**Example subject line**: "The $47,000 surprise that changed how this family thinks about insurance"
**Tone**: Storytelling, curiosity, empathy

### Stage 2: Problem-Aware
They know they have a problem but don't know solutions exist.

**Where in AgencyZoom**: Early prospecting â new leads from content, referrals, or events.
**Copy approach**: Name the problem specifically. Show you understand it better than they do.
**Example opening**: "If you've been putting off reviewing your homeowner's policy because the whole thing feels overwhelming â you're not alone. Most people we talk to feel the same way."
**Tone**: Empathetic, validating, educational

### Stage 3: Solution-Aware
They know solutions exist but haven't found yours yet.

**Where in AgencyZoom**: Mid-prospecting â leads who are shopping around.
**Copy approach**: Differentiate. Why is an independent agent better? Why THIS agency?
**Example**: "You could spend hours on comparison sites getting generic quotes â or you could have someone who knows the local market shop 20+ carriers for you in one call."
**Tone**: Confident, specific, comparison-friendly

### Stage 4: Product-Aware
They know about your agency but haven't committed.

**Where in AgencyZoom**: Post-quote follow-up, pipeline stage "Quoted" or "Follow-Up"
**Copy approach**: Overcome objections. Add urgency. Risk reversal. Social proof.
**Example**: "Just wanted to check in on the quote we put together. Most families in [Area] with a similar home are paying about $[X] â your quote came in at $[Y]. Happy to walk through it whenever works for you."
**Tone**: Casual, helpful, no pressure (but with a specific reason to act)

### Stage 5: Most Aware
They know you, like you, and just need a nudge.

**Where in AgencyZoom**: Hot leads, renewal presentations, referral requests
**Copy approach**: Just ask. Simple, direct. Maybe a small incentive.
**Example**: "Ready to get this wrapped up? I've got everything on my end â just need your green light and we'll have you covered by tomorrow."
**Tone**: Direct, warm, confident

## Market Sophistication (Schwartz) for Insurance

Insurance is a **Level 4-5 market** â highly sophisticated. Everyone's heard the claims ("save 15%," "you're in good hands," "like a good neighbor"). This means:

**What DOESN'T work:**
- Generic claims: "We'll save you money" (everyone says this)
- Feature lists: "We offer home, auto, life, commercial" (so does everyone)
- Empty promises: "Best rates guaranteed" (prospects are numb to this)

**What DOES work at Level 4-5:**
- **Mechanism**: Explain HOW you get better results. "Because we're independent, we can shop 23 carriers in 20 minutes. Captive agents can only show you one option."
- **Identification**: Make the prospect see themselves in your story. "We built this agency for people who are tired of being treated like a policy number."
- **Specificity**: Replace vague claims with precise details. Not "save money" but "our average client saves $437/year by switching from a captive agent."
- **Story**: Real client stories (anonymized) that mirror the prospect's situation.

## Gary Halbert Principles

### The A-Pile / B-Pile
Every email and text lands in one of two mental categories:
- **A-Pile**: Personal mail. You open it immediately. Feels like it's from a real person.
- **B-Pile**: Junk. Marketing. Delete without reading.

**For AgencyZoom templates**: Write like a person, not a company.

â "Dear Valued Prospect, Thank you for your interest in ABC Insurance. We offer comprehensive coverage solutions..."

â "Hey {First Name} â this is {Agent Name} over at {Agency Name}. I saw your quote request come through and wanted to reach out personally."

### The Halbert Method: Research â Story â Headline â Offer â CTA
1. **Research**: Know the prospect's situation (AgencyZoom data: lead source, policy type, location)
2. **Story**: Open with a relatable scenario or anecdote
3. **Headline/Subject**: Write the subject line LAST (it's the most important part)
4. **Offer**: What specifically are you offering in this email?
5. **CTA**: ONE clear action

### Halbert's "Star, Story, Solution"
- **Star**: Introduce a character (the prospect, or someone like them)
- **Story**: Describe their struggle
- **Solution**: Present your agency as the answer

## Dan Kennedy Principles

### The Godfather Offer
Make it so good they can't say no:
- **Compelling offer**: Free coverage review, rate comparison, risk assessment
- **Scarcity**: "I can only take on 5 new families this month to give everyone proper attention"
- **Risk reversal**: "If we can't save you at least $200, I'll send you a $25 gift card for your time"
- **Bonus**: "Plus, you'll get our Home Inventory Checklist â most people don't know they need this until after a claim"

### "Reason Why" Copy
Every outreach needs a reason for reaching out NOW:
- "Your policy renews in 90 days, which means NOW is when you have the most leverage"
- "We just got access to a new carrier that's 20% below market for homes built after 2010"
- "I noticed you requested a quote last Tuesday â most people who wait more than a week end up paying more because rates shift"

### Kennedy's Urgency Triggers (adapted for insurance)
- Rate increases coming ("Carriers are filing 8-12% increases for Q3")
- Seasonal risks ("Hurricane season starts June 1 â this is the time to review flood coverage")
- Life events ("Just bought a home? The coverage your lender required is almost never enough")
- Competitive window ("Your renewal is the one time you have maximum negotiating power")

## David Ogilvy Principles

### Headlines Do 80% of the Work
For AgencyZoom, the "headline" is the **email subject line** or **text message opening**.

**Ogilvy's headline rules applied to insurance emails:**
- Include the prospect's name when possible
- Include a specific benefit or number
- Provoke curiosity without being clickbaity

**Strong subject lines:**
- "{First Name}, your home might have a $30,000 coverage gap"
- "Quick question about your auto policy renewal"
- "The one thing most homeowners don't know about their deductible"
- "3 things I'd check before your renewal on {Date}"

**Weak subject lines:**
- "Important insurance information"
- "Your quote is ready!"
- "Don't miss out on savings"

### Specificity Sells
Replace every vague claim with a specific one:
- ~~"We can save you money"~~ â "Our average client saves $437/year"
- ~~"We have great service"~~ â "Our average claim response time is 4.2 hours"
- ~~"We know insurance"~~ â "47 combined years of P&C experience across our team"

### Long Copy vs. Short Copy
Ogilvy's rule: "Long copy sells when it's interesting."

**For AgencyZoom automation:**
- **Texts**: Always short. 1-3 sentences. One question or one CTA.
- **Prospecting emails**: Medium. 3-5 short paragraphs. Story + offer + CTA.
- **Assignment selling emails**: Can be longer. Link to content piece for the depth.
- **Onboarding emails**: Medium-long. Educational, reassuring, step-by-step.
- **Renewal emails**: Short-medium. Specific to their situation, numbers-driven.

## Chet Holmes: The Dream 100 in AgencyZoom

### Concept
Instead of chasing thousands of cold leads, identify the 100 ideal prospects (or referral partners) and pursue them with relentless, strategic, multi-channel outreach.

### Implementation in AgencyZoom

**Create a "Dream 100" Custom Pipeline** with these stages:
1. **Identified** â Research complete, added to list
2. **First Touch** â Initial outreach sent
3. **Engaged** â They've responded or engaged with content
4. **Meeting Set** â Discovery call or meeting scheduled
5. **Relationship Active** â Ongoing nurture, not yet a client
6. **Converted** â Became a client or active referral partner

**Dream 100 Categories for P&C Agencies:**
- Top 25 local businesses needing commercial coverage
- Top 25 real estate agents / mortgage brokers (referral partners)
- Top 25 high-net-worth homeowners in target neighborhoods
- Top 25 CPAs / attorneys / financial advisors (referral partners)

**Automation Sequence for Dream 100:**
- Week 1: Personal introduction email (A-pile style)
- Week 2: Send valuable content piece (Big 5 article)
- Week 3: Text or handwritten note (vary the channel)
- Week 4: Share a case study relevant to their industry
- Week 6: Invite to lunch/coffee/event
- Week 8: Send another content piece
- Week 10: Re-introduce with new "reason why"
- Monthly thereafter: Continue value-first outreach

The key is PERSISTENCE + VALUE. Never go more than 30 days without a touchpoint, and every touchpoint provides something useful â not just "checking in."

## The "You Get Me" Effect: Putting It All Together

When you combine Schwartz's awareness stages with Halbert's personal writing style and Kennedy's reason-why urgency, the prospect feels heard. They feel like you're the expert. They feel like they're in the right place. Here's why:

**At each stage, the prospect is having a specific internal conversation.** Your copy meets them where they are â acknowledging what they're feeling, demonstrating expertise, and confirming they made the right call reaching out to you:

| Stage | What they're feeling | Your copy makes them feel heard |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| New lead | "Is this agent going to hard-sell me?" | "No pressure at all â just want to make sure you have what you need to make the best decision for your family." |
| Post-quote silence | "Is this really the best deal? Should I keep shopping?" | "You're probably comparing a few quotes right now â that's smart. Here's what to look for beyond just the price..." |
| Onboarding Day 1 | "Did I make the right choice? This is a lot of money." | "Welcome aboard! You just made a decision most people put off for years. Here's exactly what happens next..." |
| 90 days before renewal | "My premium better not go up." | "Your renewal is coming up on {Date}. Before you see that number, I want you to know I've already started shopping your rates." |
| Post-claim | "I hope this is actually covered. Insurance companies always find a way to deny things." | "I just got off the phone with {Carrier}. Your claim is filed, here's your claim number, and here's exactly what to expect next..." |

This isn't a trick â it's empathy at scale. You're doing the emotional homework of understanding where each person is and meeting them there. When a customer feels heard, they trust you. When they see you anticipated their concern before they raised it, they know you're the expert. When both of those things happen, they know they're in the right place â and they stop shopping.
