# Video Strategy â Building Emotional Connection in the Sales & Service Process

## Why Video Changes Everything

Text builds trust. Video builds relationships.

An email can say "We care about you." A 60-second video where the agent looks you in the eye and says your name â that PROVES they care. Video is the closest thing to being in the room with someone, and in an industry where trust is the product, video is the most underused weapon in an agency's arsenal.

**The data is simple:** People do business with people they know, like, and trust. Text can get you "know" and "trust." Video gets you all three â including "like" â because people can see your face, hear your voice, and feel your energy. That's the emotional connection that makes someone choose your agency over the quote that's $50 cheaper.

## The Three Types of Video for Insurance Agencies

### 1. Personal 1-to-1 Videos (Highest Impact, Lowest Production)

These are short (30-90 second) videos recorded by the producer or CSR for a specific person. No script. No editing. Just look at the camera, say their name, and talk like a human.

**Tools:** Loom, BombBomb, Vidyard, or just record on your phone and text/email it.

**Why they work:** When a prospect gets a personal video instead of a templated email, the open rate doubles and the response rate triples. It's the ultimate A-pile technique â the equivalent of a handwritten letter in a world of junk mail.

### 2. Assignment Selling Videos (Trust and Grow Content Engine)

These are 3-7 minute educational videos answering the Big 5 questions. They replace or complement written articles in the assignment selling workflow. A prospect who WATCHES you explain "Why Is My Homeowners Insurance So Expensive?" trusts you more than one who reads a blog post â because they can see you're a real person who knows what they're talking about.

**Why they work:** Assignment selling already shortens the sales cycle. Assignment selling with video shortens it even more, because the prospect shows up to the call feeling like they already know you.

### 3. Process Videos (Expectation-Setting + Anxiety Reduction)

These are 1-3 minute videos that explain what happens next at each stage. "Here's what happens after you buy your policy." "Here's how to file a claim." They replace the information gap that causes anxiety and buyer's remorse.

**Why they work:** The #1 reason clients feel anxious after a purchase is uncertainty. A video that shows them exactly what to expect eliminates that uncertainty and prevents the "did I make the right choice?" spiral.

## Video at Every Pipeline Stage

### Sales Pipeline

| Stage | Video Type | What to Record | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **New Lead** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, I got your request â I'm [Agent], and I'm going to personally handle your quote. Here's what happens next..." | Immediate differentiation. No other agent is doing this. Prospect goes from "one of five agents I contacted" to "the one who actually seems like a person." |
| **Contacted** | Personal 1-to-1 | Quick follow-up if they haven't responded: "Hey {First Name}, just wanted to put a face to the name â I left you a voicemail earlier..." | Turns a cold follow-up into a warm one. They've now seen your face. You're not a stranger anymore. |
| **Quoted** | Personal 1-to-1 | Quote walkthrough: Screen-share the proposal, explain coverage in plain English, point to specific things that matter for their situation | This is the game-changer. Instead of emailing a PDF and hoping they understand it, you SHOW them. Producers who do video quote presentations close at 20-30% higher rates. |
| **Follow-Up** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, I know you're thinking it over â totally normal. I wanted to share one thing about your coverage that I think matters..." | Addresses the post-quote silence with a human touch. Way harder to ignore than another email. |
| **Lost (Re-engage)** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, I know we didn't connect last time â things change, and I just wanted you to know we're still here..." | A 30-second video 6 months later can reopen a dead lead. Nobody else is doing this. |

### Onboarding Pipeline

| Stage | Video Type | What to Record | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Welcome** | Personal 1-to-1 from CSR | "Hi {First Name}, I'm {CSR Name} â I'll be your go-to person for anything you need. Welcome to the family." | This is the warmest possible handoff. The client immediately knows WHO to call and what they look like. |
| **Policy Review** | Process Video (reusable) | "Here's a quick walkthrough of your policy â what's covered, what to know, and the one thing most homeowners overlook..." | Prevents the "I didn't know that wasn't covered" conversation. Also builds trust because you're being proactively transparent. |
| **Fully Onboarded** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, you're all set. Just wanted to make sure you know â if anything ever comes up, call me directly at [number]." | Cements the relationship. The last touch of onboarding is personal and human, not automated. |

### Service Pipeline

| Stage | Video Type | What to Record | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Claim Filed** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, I heard about what happened â I'm sorry. Here's exactly what's going to happen next, and I'm going to be checking in with you throughout..." | This is the moment of truth. A personal video during a claim experience creates a client for life. This is when they're most vulnerable, and a face-to-face connection (even via video) matters more than anything else you'll ever send. |
| **Proactive Check-In** | Personal 1-to-1 | Mid-term: "Hey {First Name}, just checking in â it's been about 6 months. Anything changed in your life? New car, home project, teenager driving? Let's make sure you're still covered right." | This is the retention play. A 45-second video check-in twice a year makes the difference between a client who remembers your name and one who doesn't. |

### Renewal Pipeline

| Stage | Video Type | What to Record | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **90-Day Review** | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, your renewal is coming up in about 90 days. I'm already starting to review your policy and shop around â just wanted you to know I'm on it." | Proactive. The client knows you're working for them BEFORE the bill arrives. |
| **Rate Increase** | Personal 1-to-1 (CRITICAL) | "Hey {First Name}, I want to talk to you about your renewal. Your rate went up, and I want to explain why and show you what I've done about it..." | THIS is the video that saves accounts. A rate increase delivered via letter or email feels impersonal and uncaring. A rate increase delivered face-to-face (via video) with an explanation and options feels like someone fighting for you. |
| **Renewal Presentation** | Personal 1-to-1 | Screen-share the renewal options, walk through the comparison, make a recommendation | Same as the initial quote walkthrough. Show, don't tell. The client sees you care enough to personally walk them through it. |
| **Win-Back(* | Personal 1-to-1 | "Hey {First Name}, I know you moved on, and I respect that. But I wanted you to know â if things don't work out, we'd love to have you back. No hard feelings, no pressure." | Dignity and class. The other agent isn't doing this. And when the new agent fails (they often do), your face is the one they remember. |

- "The One Question You Should Ask Any Agent Before Buying a Policy"

## The AgencyZoom Integration

### Where Video Lives in the Workflow

Video doesn't replace AgencyZoom automation â it supercharges it. Here's how they work together:

**Automation triggers the task â The person records the video â AgencyZoom tracks it**

Example workflow:
1. New lead enters pipeline â AgencyZoom creates task: "Record personal welcome video for {First Name}"
2. Producer records 45-second Loom video
3. Producer pastes Loom link into AgencyZoom email/text template
4. AgencyZoom sends it at the right time
5. Producer marks task complete, moves lead to next stage

**The task description in AgencyZoom should include:**
- WHO to record for (first name, situation)
- WHAT to say (key points, not a script â keep it natural)
- HOW LONG it should be (30 seconds? 60 seconds? 3 minutes?)
- WHERE to upload (Loom link in template, text with video link, etc.)

### Video Tasks in Pipeline Blueprints

When building pipeline stages, include video tasks alongside email/text automation:

**Day 0 â New Lead:**
- Auto: Send welcome email (text-based, immediate)
- Task (within 1 hour): "Record personal welcome video for {First Name}. Say their name, tell them you'll personally handle their quote, mention one thing specific to their request. 30-45 seconds. Paste Loom link and send via text."

**Day 1 â Post-Quote:**
- Task: "Record video quote walkthrough for {First Name}. Screen-share their proposal, explain the coverage in plain English, point to 2-3 things that matter for their specific situation. 2-3 minutes. Email with subject line: '{First Name}, I walked through your coverage â here's what matters.'"

**Day 14 â Onboarding Welcome:**
- Task (CSR): "Record personal welcome video for {First Name}. Introduce yourself by name, tell them you're their go-to, give your direct number. 30 seconds. Text it with: 'Hey {First Name}, welcome! Quick video intro from me.'"

## The Emotional Connection Playbook

### Why Video Creates Trust That Text Can't

There are three levels of communication trust:

1. **Text** â Lowest emotional bandwidth. Easy to produce, easy to ignore. The prospect reads your words through their own internal voice, which may not match your intent.

2. **Audio** â Medium bandwidth. Voicemails and calls add tone, warmth, and personality. But the prospect still doesn't see you.

3. **Video** â Highest bandwidth. Face, voice, body language, eye contact, energy, sincerity. The prospect can tell in 3 seconds if you're genuine. You can't fake empathy on camera.

### The "Know, Like, Trust" Acceleration

Without video:
- **Know** â Takes 3-5 touchpoints (emails, calls) before they remember who you are
- **Like** â Takes a phone conversation or meeting before they decide if they like you
- **Trust** â Takes consistent delivery over weeks

With video:
- **Know** â First video. They see your face, hear your voice, know your name.
- **Like** â First video. If you're warm, genuine, and human, they decide immediately.
- **Trust** â Second or third video. Consistency on camera accelerates trust faster than any email sequence.

### The Emotional Moments That DEMAND Video

Some moments in the insurance lifecycle are so emotionally charged that text is almost disrespectful. These are the moments where video isn't optional â it's the difference between a transaction and a relationship:

1. **The claim** â They're scared, frustrated, or hurting. A face makes all the difference.
2. **The rate increase** â They feel like nobody's fighting for them. A face saying "I fought for you" changes the conversation.
3. **The welcome** â They just trusted you with their protection. Acknowledge the weight of that decision with your face, not a template.
4. **The win-back** â They left. Reaching out with your face shows humility and class that an email never will.
5. **The renewal** â A year has passed. Seeing your face reminds them why they chose you.

## Getting the Team to Actually Do It

The biggest barrier to video isn't technology â it's discomfort. Producers and CSRs will resist. Here's how to get past it:

### Start with the "Ugly Video" Exercise
Have everyone record a 30-second video right now. No prep. No script. Just say: "Hey, I'm [name], I'm an agent at [agency], and I help people like you make sure they're properly protected." Play them back. Laugh at the awkwardness. Do it three more times. By the fourth take, it's natural.

### The 80% Rule
80% of the value comes from just doing it. A "bad" personal video beats a "perfect" templated email every single time. Don't let the team get stuck on production quality. Phone camera. Natural light. Look at the lens. Talk like a human. Done.

### The 3-Video Challenge
Challenge the team: record 3 personal videos this week. That's it. Three. One for a new lead. One for a quoted prospect. One for an existing client check-in. Track the response rates. Once they see the difference, they won't go back.

### Accountability in AgencyZoom
Build video tasks into the automation. When AgencyZoom generates a task that says "Record personal video for {First Name}," it becomes part of the workflow â not an optional nice-to-have. Track completion rates on the dashboard. Celebrate the producers who do it consistently.
