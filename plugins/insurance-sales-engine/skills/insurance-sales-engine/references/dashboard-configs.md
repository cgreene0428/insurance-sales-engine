# AgencyZoom Dashboard Configurations by Role

## The Dashboard = Where CX Meets EX

Dashboards are the bridge between customer experience and employee experience. Without the right dashboard, the best automation in the world fails â because the employee can't SEE what the customer needs.

Think of it this way:
- **CX is the promise**: "We'll take care of you, you'll never fall through the cracks."
- **EX is the delivery system**: tasks, reminders, automation.
- **The dashboard is the visibility layer**: it shows the employee WHERE every customer is, WHO needs attention NOW, and WHAT'S about to break.

A dashboard that only shows metrics is useless to a CSR with 15 things to do today. A dashboard that only shows tasks misses the bigger picture an owner needs. Each role needs a dashboard designed for HOW they work and WHAT they need to see to deliver a great customer experience.

## Producer / Sales Agent Dashboard

**Core question**: "What should I do RIGHT NOW to close more business â and who's about to slip away?"

### CX Visibility (How the producer sees the customer's experience):
- **Lead Response Time**: How quickly are new leads being contacted? (Target: <5 min for text, <4 hours for call). If this number is bad, customers are having a bad first impression.
- **Pipeline Health by Stage**: Where are leads piling up? If 20 leads are stuck in "Quoted" for 7+ days, that's 20 customers thinking "this agent forgot about me."
- **Content Engagement**: Which prospects opened emails, clicked articles, watched videos? These are buying signals â a prospect who read your pricing article is telling you they're interested.
- **Days in Stage**: No lead should sit in any stage for more than the blueprint says. Leads aging past the target = customers having a bad experience.

### EX Clarity (What the producer needs to execute):
- **Today's Tasks** (TOP of dashboard, biggest widget): Sorted by priority. Each task shows: contact name, phone, what to do, and why NOW. The producer opens their dashboard and knows EXACTLY what to do first. Zero guessing.
- **Hot Leads Queue**: Leads ranked by engagement score. Producer works top-down. No analysis paralysis.
- **New Leads (Uncontacted)**: Flashing/highlighted. These are time-sensitive â every minute without contact drops close rate.
- **Quote Follow-Up Queue**: Quotes sent but not closed, sorted by days since sent. Color-coded: Green (<3 days), Yellow (3-7 days), Red (>7 days).
- **Stale Lead Alert**: Any lead with no activity in 48h gets flagged. Task auto-creates: "This lead is going cold. Act now."

### Performance (Motivation + Accountability):
- **Close Rate**: This month vs. last month. Simple.
- **Revenue Scoreboard**: Premium written MTD/QTD/YTD.
- **Activity Score**: Calls + emails + texts this week. Not to micromanage â to create healthy competition.

### Dream 100 View:
- Dedicated tab: each Dream 100 prospect with next action due and days since last touch
- Flag: anything >30 days since last touchpoint = relationship cooling

### Alerts:
- New lead assigned â instant push notification (CX: fast response. EX: immediate action.)
- Lead clicked content â notification ("They're warm â call now")
- Quote >5 days old with no follow-up â task + alert
- Lead marked "Lost" â notification for debrief and learning

## Account Manager / CSR Dashboard

**Core question**: "Who needs my attention today, and is anyone about to fall through the cracks?"

This dashboard is the most critical for CX because CSRs/AMs touch clients at every stage: onboarding, service, renewals, claims. If ANYTHING goes wrong in the client experience, this dashboard should surface it immediately.

### CX Visibility (How the CSR sees every client's experience):

- **Onboarding Status Board**: Every client in onboarding, which stage they're at, next step due, days since last contact. Any client who hasn't heard from the agency in 3+ days â RED flag. Because that client is sitting there wondering "did they forget about me?"
- **Renewal Countdown**: 30/60/90 day view. Color-coded:
  - Green (on track, remarketed, options ready)
  - Yellow (remarketed but no quotes back yet, or client hasn't responded to scheduling)
  - Red (within 30 days and no renewal presented, OR client non-responsive)
  - This is CX protection: a Red renewal means a client is about to get a surprise bill or shop somewhere else.
- **Service Request Age**: Open requests sorted by how long they've been open. Anything >48h = the customer is waiting and getting frustrated. The dashboard should make >48h requests impossible to ignore.
- **Client Sentiment Signals**: Recent reviews, NPS scores, complaint flags, claims in progress. This tells the CSR: "This client is happy" or "This client is at risk."
- **Cross-Sell Opportunities**: Clients with coverage gaps (home but no umbrella, auto but no life). Not a sales metric â it's a CX metric: these clients are UNDERPROTECTED.

### EX Clarity (What the CSR does with zero confusion):

- **Today's Tasks** (TOP of dashboard): Every task is specific. Not "Follow up with client" but "Call Sarah Johnson (555-1234) â renewal quote ready, walk her through 3 options, schedule 10-min review." The CSR opens the task and ACTS. No thinking required.
- **Waiting On** Split View:
  - **Waiting on Client**: Items where the CSR sent something and is waiting for a response. Shows days waiting and auto-generates follow-up reminders.
  - **Waiting on Carrier**: Items where the CSR is waiting on a carrier response. Shows days waiting and auto-generates carrier follow-up tasks.
  - This split matters because it answers: "What can I work on NOW vs. what am I blocked on?" Without it, the CSR wastes time checking on things they can't move yet.
- **Handoff Inbox**: New clients transitioning from producer to CSR. Shows: client name, policy details, producer notes, what's been promised to the client. No "wait, what did the producer tell them?" moments.
- **Escalation Queue**: Anything that's overdue or at risk. The CSR shouldn't have to hunt for problems â the dashboard pushes problems TO them.

### Alerts:
- Renewal 90 days out â trigger remarketing task (CX: proactive. EX: plenty of time.)
- Client replied to automation email â immediate notification (CX: they engaged. EX: respond while they're engaged.)
- Onboarding step overdue â escalation (CX: client is waiting. EX: act now.)
- Claim filed â immediate notification (CX: client is stressed. EX: drop everything for claims.)
- Service request >48h â priority flag (CX: client patience is running out. EX: resolve or update today.)
- Cross-sell opportunity identified â soft notification (CX: client needs protection. EX: plant the seed at the right time.)

## Agency Owner / Principal Dashboard

**Core question**: "Is my agency healthy, growing, and running without me â and where is the CX breaking down?"

The owner dashboard is strategic. It's not about individual tasks â it's about PATTERNS. Where is the system working? Where is it breaking? Where are customers having a great experience, and where are they being let down?

### CX Health Metrics (Is the customer experience working?):

- **Lead Response Time (Average)**: Agency-wide average time from lead submission to first contact. Target: <5 minutes for auto-text, <4 hours for personal call. If this is trending up, CX is degrading at the front door.
- **Pipeline Stage Duration**: Average days at each pipeline stage vs. target. If "Quoted" averages 12 days when the target is 7, customers are waiting too long and going elsewhere.
- **Automation Engagement**: Email open rates, text response rates, content click rates. This tells you: Is the copy working? Are customers engaging with the content? Low engagement = the messaging isn't resonating = CX feels generic.
- **Retention Rate**: Rolling 12-month with monthly trend. THE ultimate CX metric. If retention is dropping, clients are having a bad enough experience to leave.
- **Service Resolution Time**: Average time from service request to resolution. Clients judge agencies by how fast problems get fixed.
- **Claims Satisfaction**: Post-claim follow-up responses. The claims experience defines the relationship.
- **Review Score Trend**: Google review average over time. Direct voice of the customer.

### EX Health Metrics (Is the team able to deliver?):

- **Task Completion Rate**: What % of tasks are completed on time vs. overdue? If it's below 85%, either there are too many tasks (system overload) or people are confused about what to do (EX failure).
- **Team Activity by Person**: Calls, emails, texts per team member. Not for micromanagement â for identifying who's overloaded and who has capacity.
- **Overdue Task Count by Person**: Shows you where the bottleneck is. If one CSR has 30 overdue tasks, that's not a performance problem â it's a capacity problem.
- **Producer Leaderboard**: Ranked by premium written, close rate, and activity. Drives healthy competition.
- **Stale Pipeline Count**: How many leads/renewals/service requests are past their target timeline? This is the "crack" metric â things falling through.

### Business Performance:

- **Revenue Summary**: Total premium written MTD/QTD/YTD with trend line
- **Pipeline Total Value**: Sum of all active opportunities
- **New Business vs. Retention**: Side-by-side. Healthy agencies grow both.
- **Lead Source ROI**: Which lead sources produce the highest close rate AND highest premium. Stop spending on sources that don't convert.
- **Line of Business Breakdown**: Personal vs. commercial vs. other
- **Carrier Mix**: Distribution of business by carrier (watch for concentration risk)
- **Cross-Sell Penetration**: % of clients with 2+ policies. Higher = stickier clients = better retention.
- **Growth Trajectory**: Month-over-month premium growth

### Alerts:
- Revenue milestone â celebration to team (EX: recognition matters)
- Retention drops below threshold â investigation flag
- Producer activity below minimum â coaching flag
- Any lead/renewal overdue >2x target duration â owner visibility
- Monthly report auto-generated and emailed

## Dashboard Design Principles

### 1. Action First, Metrics Second
Every dashboard should lead with "what to do" not "how you're doing." The producer opens AgencyZoom and sees Today's Tasks, not a revenue chart. The CSR sees their queue, not a retention graph. Metrics support the work â they don't replace it.

### 2. Color = Priority
Use color consistently across all dashboards:
- **Red**: Overdue, at risk, needs immediate action
- **Yellow**: Approaching deadline, needs attention soon
- **Green**: On track, no action needed now
- **Blue**: Informational, FYI

### 3. No Vanity Metrics
Every widget on the dashboard should answer one of two questions:
- "What should I do?" (action)
- "Is there a problem I need to know about?" (alert)

If a metric doesn't drive action or surface a problem, it doesn't belong on a daily dashboard. Put it in a monthly report instead.

### 4. CX/EX Pairing
For every CX metric on the owner dashboard, there should be a corresponding EX metric that explains it:
- Low retention? â Check service resolution time and task completion rate
- Low close rate? â Check lead response time and days-in-stage
- Low content engagement? â Check if emails are being sent (automation on?) and if subject lines are getting opens

### 5. The 5-Second Rule
An employee should be able to open their dashboard and know what to do FIRST within 5 seconds. If they have to scroll, filter, or interpret â the dashboard is too complex.
