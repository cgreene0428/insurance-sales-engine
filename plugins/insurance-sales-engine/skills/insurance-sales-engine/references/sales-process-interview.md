# Sales Process Deep-Dive Interview

## Why This Interview Exists

Agencies always think they know their sales process. They don't — not completely. There are handoffs nobody's documented, steps that happen "sometimes," leads that fall into a black hole between stages, and entire categories of prospects that get treated the same when they shouldn't.

This interview fixes that. Before a single pipeline is built or a single email is written, Claude conducts a thorough interview with the agency owner (and ideally key team members), asking the questions that expose every gap, assumption, and overlooked step.

**The goal isn't just to document what they DO — it's to uncover what they SHOULD be doing but aren't.**

## How to Conduct This Interview

**Voice and tone**: You are interviewing as Chris Greene. Be direct, conversational, and curious. Don't accept surface-level answers. When someone says "we follow up," ask "how exactly — call, text, email? How many times? What do you say? What if they don't respond?" Dig until you hit bedrock.

**Format**: Ask ONE section at a time. Don't dump all 100 questions at once — that's overwhelming and they'll give shallow answers. Go section by section, and follow up on anything that sounds vague or assumed.

**Listen for red flags**: When they say "it depends," "usually," "sometimes," or "I think" — that's where the process is broken. Those are the spots where leads fall through cracks.

**The interview should feel like a conversation**, not an interrogation. You're helping them see their own business clearly — many of these questions will make them realize things they've never thought about.

---

## Section 1: Lead Sources & First Contact

Start here. Where leads come from determines everything about how they should be handled.

### Questions:

1. **Where do your leads come from?** List every source — referrals, website forms, phone calls, walk-ins, purchased lead lists, social media, Google ads, Zillow, realtor partnerships, community events, anything.

2. **Which lead source has your highest close rate?** (Most agencies don't know this. If they don't, that's a finding.)

3. **Which lead source brings in the most volume?** (Volume and close rate are different — low-close-rate high-volume sources might be eating your team's time.)

4. **When a lead comes in, who gets it?** Is it round-robin? Does a specific producer get specific types? Does the owner still take leads? Is there a gatekeeper (receptionist, office manager)?

5. **How fast does someone reach out to a new lead?** Be honest — not the goal, the reality. Same day? Within an hour? Next day? "When we get to it"?

6. **What's the FIRST thing that happens when a lead comes in?** Phone call? Text? Email? All three? Who decides?

7. **Do different lead sources get treated differently?** (A referral from your best client should NOT get the same generic response as a random web form. If they're treating all leads the same, that's a problem.)

8. **What happens to leads that come in after hours or on weekends?** Do they sit until Monday? Is there an auto-response? Does someone get a notification?

9. **Have you ever tracked how many leads come in that never get contacted?** (This question often produces silence. That silence is the answer.)

10. **What information do you collect from the lead at first contact?** Name and phone? Full application? Something in between?

---

## Section 2: The Quoting Process

This is where most agencies have the most chaos — and the most opportunity.

### Questions:

11. **Walk me through exactly what happens from "I need a quote" to "here's your quote."** Every step. Who does what? How long does each step take?

12. **How do you gather the information you need to quote?** Phone interview? Online form? Request dec pages? All of the above?

13. **How do you request dec pages from prospects?** Email? Text? And what happens when they don't send them? How many times do you follow up?

14. **How many carriers do you typically quote?** Is it always the same ones, or does it depend on the risk?

15. **What rating tools do you use?** Raters? Direct carrier portals? Both?

16. **How long does it take from "I have all the info" to "the quote is ready"?** Same day? Next day? Three days? A week?

17. **Who presents the quote?** The producer who took the lead, or someone else?

18. **HOW do you present the quote?** Phone call? In person? Email a PDF? Video call? Just email it and hope?

19. **Do you present one option or multiple options?** If multiple, how many? How do you frame the comparison?

20. **What do you say when you present the quote?** Do you have a script? Talking points? Or does each producer wing it?

21. **Do you explain what the coverage actually means, or just show the price?** (Most agents just show price. That's why they lose on price.)

22. **What happens if the prospect doesn't respond after you send the quote?** How many follow-ups? Over how many days? What channels? What do you say?

23. **What's your close rate on quotes?** (If they don't know, that's a major finding. If they say "pretty good," push for a number.)

24. **What's the #1 reason people DON'T buy from you after getting a quote?** Price? Already have an agent? Never responded? What does your gut say?

---

## Section 3: Objection Handling

Most agencies have never mapped their objections — they just react in the moment.

### Questions:

25. **What are the top 5 objections you hear?** List them. (Common ones: "I need to think about it," "Your price is higher," "I'm happy with my current agent," "I'll call you back," "My spouse needs to review it.")

26. **For each objection, what do you say?** Do you have a response, or does it depend on who's talking?

27. **Do you have any written objection-handling guides or scripts?** (Almost nobody does. This is a huge opportunity for the buildout — we can bake objection responses into follow-up automation.)

28. **When someone says "I need to think about it," what happens next?** (This is the #1 deal-killer in insurance. The answer reveals everything about their follow-up discipline.)

29. **When someone says "your price is higher," how do you handle it?** Do you just drop the price? Explain the coverage difference? Offer a different option? Give up?

30. **Do you ever lose deals and NOT know why?** (Yes. Always. The question is whether they're tracking it.)

---

## Section 4: Follow-Up Discipline

This section exposes the biggest revenue leak in most agencies.

### Questions:

31. **After you send a quote, what's your follow-up process?** Step by step. Be specific — day 1, day 3, day 7, etc.

32. **How many times do you follow up before giving up?** (Most agents: 1-2 times. The data says it takes 5-12 touches.)

33. **What channels do you use for follow-up?** Phone only? Email? Text? Mix?

34. **Do you have a system for follow-up, or is it memory-based?** (If the answer is "I just try to remember" or "I keep a list" — that's a system that fails at scale.)

35. **What happens to leads that go cold?** Do they go into a long-term nurture? Get deleted? Sit in a spreadsheet forever?

36. **Do you ever re-engage old leads?** How? When? What triggers it?

37. **How many leads are sitting in your pipeline RIGHT NOW that nobody has contacted in the last 30 days?** (This number is usually shocking. It represents real money that's evaporating.)

38. **If I pulled up your CRM right now, how many "open" leads would I see that are actually dead?** (Pipeline hygiene. Most agencies have a dirty pipeline full of leads that will never close but nobody wants to mark as lost.)

---

## Section 5: The Handoff — From Sale to Service

This is the moment most agencies fumble. The producer closes the deal and moves on. The client enters a void.

### Questions:

39. **When a sale is made, what happens next?** Who does what? In what order?

40. **How does the client find out who their ongoing contact is?** Does the producer introduce the CSR? Does the CSR reach out? Does nobody tell them and they just call the main number?

41. **What does the producer tell the CSR about the new client?** Is there a formal handoff? Notes? A meeting? Or does the CSR just see a new name in the system?

42. **From the CLIENT'S perspective, what happens between "I bought the policy" and "I feel fully set up"?** Map it out. Is there a gap? A black hole? A moment where they wonder "did I make the right choice?"

43. **Do you have a formal onboarding process?** If yes, walk me through it. If "sort of," that means no.

44. **Do you do a policy review with new clients?** When? Who conducts it? What do you cover?

45. **How long does it take for a new client to go from "just bought" to "fully onboarded"?** Days? Weeks? "It depends"?

46. **Do new clients ever call in confused about their coverage in the first 30 days?** What do they ask? (These questions should be answered proactively during onboarding — if clients are calling with questions, the onboarding isn't thorough enough.)

---

## Section 6: Service & Ongoing Relationship

### Questions:

47. **When a client calls with a service request, what happens?** Who answers? How is it tracked? How does the client know it's being handled?

48. **What's your average response time on service requests?** Same day? Next day? "Whenever we get to it"?

49. **Do clients know who to call when they have a question?** Or do they call the main number and explain their situation to whoever answers?

50. **How do you handle claims?** Walk me through it from the client's perspective — they just had a pipe burst or a car accident. What do they experience?

51. **Do you proactively reach out to clients, or only when they call you?** (Proactive outreach = retention. Reactive only = they'll leave when someone else offers proactive service.)

52. **How often do you touch clients between sales and renewal?** Once? Twice? Never? What's the communication?

53. **Do you do mid-term reviews?** Annual reviews? Any scheduled touchpoints?

54. **Do you send birthday cards, holiday messages, or any personal touches?** (Not required, but it tells you about the agency's relationship philosophy.)

---

## Section 7: Cross-Selling & Account Rounding

### Questions:

55. **What percentage of your clients have more than one policy with you?** (If they don't know, that's a finding.)

56. **Do you have a system for identifying cross-sell opportunities?** Or does it happen "when it comes up naturally"?

57. **How do you bring up additional coverage?** During the sale? During onboarding? During renewal? Random?

58. **What additional lines do you most commonly cross-sell?** Umbrella? Life? Auto to homeowners? Commercial to personal?

59. **Do you track which clients are "monoline" (one policy only)?** Can you pull that list right now?

60. **What's your approach to cross-selling — educational or transactional?** Do you explain WHY they need umbrella coverage, or just ask "do you want umbrella?"

---

## Section 8: Renewals & Retention

### Questions:

61. **What's your retention rate?** (If they don't know the exact number, that tells you a lot.)

62. **What happens when a renewal comes up?** Walk me through the process from 90 days out to renewal date.

63. **Do you proactively remarket renewals, or only when the client complains about the price?**

64. **How far in advance do you start the renewal process?** 90 days? 60? 30? "When the client calls"?

65. **When there's a rate increase, how do you handle it?** Do you call the client proactively? Wait for them to call? Send a letter?

66. **What do you say when a client's premium goes up?** Do you have talking points? Or does each person handle it differently?

67. **When a client says they're shopping around, what's your response?** Do you remarket? Match? Let them go? Fight for them?

68. **Do you know WHY clients leave?** Do you track it? What are the top reasons?

69. **Do you have a win-back process for lost clients?** Or once they're gone, they're gone?

70. **What percentage of non-renewals are surprises vs. expected?** (If most are surprises, the renewal process is too late and too passive.)

---

## Section 9: Team & Roles

### Questions:

71. **Who's on your team and what does each person do?** (Get specific — not just titles, but actual daily activities.)

72. **Does everyone know exactly what they're responsible for, or is there overlap and confusion?**

73. **Who handles what when someone is out sick or on vacation?** Is there a backup plan?

74. **Do your producers also service their accounts, or is there a clean split?**

75. **How do you hold people accountable?** Daily huddles? Weekly meetings? Pipeline reviews? Nothing?

76. **What does a typical day look like for your best producer? Your CSR? You?**

77. **Where is the biggest bottleneck in your agency right now?** What slows everything down?

78. **If you could fix ONE thing about how your team works, what would it be?**

---

## Section 10: Technology & Tools

### Questions:

79. **What AMS do you use?** How comfortable is your team with it? Are you using it to its full potential?

80. **What other tools do you use daily?** Raters, communication tools, calendar, task management, etc.

81. **Are you currently using AgencyZoom?** If yes, what's set up? What's working? What's not? If no, what are you hoping it will fix?

82. **How do you currently track leads?** Spreadsheet? AMS? CRM? Sticky notes? Memory?

83. **How do you currently track tasks and follow-ups?** Is there a system, or is it each person's own method?

84. **Do you have email templates or scripts?** Or does everyone write from scratch every time?

85. **Do you use text messaging to communicate with clients?** If yes, is it tracked in the system or personal phones?

---

## Section 11: Marketing & Content

### Questions:

86. **Do you have a website?** Does it clearly explain what you do, who you help, and how to get started? (Trust and Grow grunt test)

87. **Do you create any content — blog posts, videos, social media, newsletters?** If yes, how often? If no, why not?

88. **If a prospect Googles "insurance agent in [your area]," where do you show up?**

89. **Do you ask for Google reviews?** How? When? How many do you have? What's your rating?

90. **Do you have any educational content you send to prospects before the sales conversation?** (Assignment selling — the answer is almost always no, and this is a massive opportunity.)

91. **What would happen if a prospect could read an article on YOUR site answering every question they have about cost, coverage, and how to choose an agent — BEFORE they ever call you?** (This is the Trust and Grow content engine in action. Let them feel the power of it.)

---

## Section 12: The Overlooked Questions

These are the ones nobody thinks to ask. They often reveal the biggest opportunities.

### Questions:

92. **What happens to a lead on Friday at 4:45 PM?** (Reveals after-hours process — or lack thereof.)

93. **If your best producer quit tomorrow, what would happen to their pipeline and their clients?** (Reveals documentation and system dependency.)

94. **When was the last time you lost a deal you SHOULD have won?** What happened? (Reveals process gaps.)

95. **Do you know what your competitors are saying about you?** What are prospects hearing before they talk to you?

96. **What's the last thing a prospect sees from you before they make their decision?** Is it a quote PDF? A follow-up text? Nothing for 5 days?

97. **If I called your agency right now as a prospect, what would happen?** Who answers? What do they say? How fast would I get a callback if nobody answered?

98. **What's the one thing your best clients say about you that your prospects DON'T know yet?** (This often becomes the core of the BrandScript.)

99. **What's the question you're afraid to ask your team because you might not like the answer?** (This usually points directly to the biggest problem.)

100. **If we could only fix THREE things in your sales process, what would have the biggest impact on your revenue in the next 90 days?** (Forces prioritization. The buildout should focus on these three things FIRST.)

---

## Section 13: The Trust Test — Walk Your Own Process as the Customer

This is the most important part of the entire interview. Everything above was about understanding the process from the inside. Now flip it.

**Tell the agency owner:**

"I want you to do something right now. Forget you own this agency. Pretend you're a homeowner in [your area] who just bought a new house and needs insurance. You Google agents, you find YOUR agency, you go to YOUR website, you fill out YOUR form, you get YOUR auto-response, you receive YOUR follow-up text, you get YOUR email sequence, you sit through YOUR quoting process, you hear YOUR quote presentation, you experience YOUR follow-up.

Walk through every single step. And at EVERY step, ask yourself ONE question:

**Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?**

That's it. One question at every stage."

### Walk-Through Stages:

**1. Your website:**
- Go to your own website right now. Spend 5 seconds. Can you tell: what you offer, how it makes my life better, and what I should do next? (Trust and Grow grunt test)
- Does it feel like a real person runs this place, or like a template?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**2. Your first response:**
- Submit a lead on your own form. What happens? How fast? What does the auto-response say?
- Read the text and email you receive as a prospect. Does it feel personal, or like marketing?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**3. Your follow-up:**
- If you don't respond for 2 days, what happens? Do they follow up? How many times? What does the follow-up say?
- Does it feel like someone who cares, or someone who wants a commission?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**4. Your quoting conversation:**
- When the producer calls, what do they say? Do they ask about YOUR situation, or just collect data for the form?
- Do you feel like they understand your concerns? Or are they rushing to a quote?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**5. Your quote presentation:**
- How is the quote delivered? Is it a confusing PDF full of jargon? A clear comparison? A phone call that explains everything in plain English?
- After seeing the quote, do you understand what you're buying? Or are you just looking at a number?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**6. Your post-quote silence:**
- If you don't respond to the quote for 5 days, what happens? Nothing? A generic follow-up? Something that addresses what you're actually thinking?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**7. Your onboarding:**
- You said yes. Now what? Is there a welcome? Does someone explain what happens next? Or is it just... silence until you get a bill?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**8. Your ongoing relationship:**
- It's been 6 months. Have you heard from your agent? At all? Would you even remember their name if someone asked?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**9. Your renewal:**
- It's renewal time. Did your agent reach out proactively, or did you just get a notice with a higher number?
- If the price went up, did anyone explain why? Did anyone fight for you?
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

**10. Your claim:**
- Something bad happened. You need to file a claim. Do you know who to call? Does your agent answer? Do they walk you through it, or hand you an 800 number?
- This is the moment of truth. Right here.
- Do I trust this company? Would I buy from them?

### Part B: The Role-Play — You're the Prospect, I'm Your Producer

After the mental walk-through, it's time to make it real. This is the part that makes agency owners squirm — and that's exactly why it works.

**Tell the agency owner:**

"Okay, now we're going to do this live. I'm going to play your sales producer — I'm going to say exactly the kinds of things your team says at each stage. You be the prospect. A homeowner, just bought a house, shopping for insurance. Your job is simple: react honestly. If what I say would turn you off, say so. If it would make you trust me, say that too. Don't overthink it — just be a real person hearing this for the first time."

**The producer role-play scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: The First Call**
- Call the agency owner. Use the same greeting their team uses. Ask the same opening questions their producers ask.
- After the greeting, ask: "How did that feel? Would you keep talking, or would you already be thinking about calling the next agent?"
- Push: "If I called you back and said the exact same thing but 4 hours later instead of 15 minutes, does that change your answer?"

**Scenario 2: The Information Gathering**
- Walk through the quoting intake the way their team does it. Ask the same questions in the same order.
- After: "Did that feel like someone trying to help me, or someone filling out a form? Did you feel heard, or processed?"
- Push: "Did I ask you anything about what MATTERS to you? Or just about what I need to generate a number?"

**Scenario 3: The Quote Presentation**
- Present a quote the way their team presents it. Same format, same words, same approach.
- After: "Do you understand what you're buying? Or are you just looking at a price? If two other agents sent you the same thing, what would make you pick one over the other?"
- Push: "What if I just emailed this to you with 'Let me know if you have questions'? What would you actually DO?"

**Scenario 4: The Follow-Up**
- Do the follow-up the way their team does it. Say what they say. Use the same timing.
- After: "Be honest — does this feel like someone who cares about protecting your family? Or someone who wants a sale?"
- Push: "If you were busy and didn't respond, and then you got this follow-up a week later, would you even remember who sent it?"

**Scenario 5: The Objection**
- As the prospect, give their most common objection: "Your price is a little higher than what I got from the other agent."
- Let the agency owner hear how their team responds — or watch them struggle to respond at all.
- After: "Did that answer make you feel confident in paying more? Or did it make you want to go with the cheaper option?"

**Scenario 6: The Post-Sale Silence**
- Say: "Okay, I bought the policy. It's been 2 weeks. As your producer, I haven't called, texted, or emailed you since you signed. How do you feel?"
- Push: "A piece of mail just arrived from another insurance company offering to save you money. You don't really remember your agent's name. Do you call them? Or do you call the number on the mailer?"

**Scenario 7: The Renewal Surprise**
- Say: "It's renewal time. I'm your producer. Your premium went up 15%. I didn't call you. You just got the bill. Now I'm calling because you called ME — upset. Go."
- Let them experience what their clients experience.
- After: "Now let's do it the RIGHT way. I'm calling you 60 days before renewal, proactively, with an explanation and options. Feel the difference?"

**Why the role-play works:**

The mental walk-through (Part A) lets agency owners see the gaps intellectually. The role-play makes them FEEL the gaps emotionally. And people don't change processes because of logic — they change because something made them uncomfortable enough to act.

Every moment in the role-play where the agency owner cringes, hesitates, or says "Yeah, that's not great" becomes a buildout priority. Because if THEY wouldn't buy from their own producer in that scenario, neither will their prospects.

### The Moment of Honesty

Most agency owners who do this exercise honestly will find 3-5 stages where the honest answer is: **"No. I wouldn't trust this. I wouldn't buy."**

Those stages ARE the buildout. That's where we focus first. Not on the stages that are already working — on the ones where a real human being would walk away.

**Every stage where the answer is "no" gets a CX fix (what should the customer experience instead?) and an EX fix (what should the employee do differently to deliver that experience?).**

This exercise should be done BEFORE building a single pipeline. The gaps it reveals become the #1 priority of the entire AgencyZoom buildout.

---

## Section 14: The Service Pipeline Deep-Dive — What Happens After the Sale?

Most agencies spend 90% of their energy on getting new clients and 10% on keeping them. That's backwards. The service experience IS your marketing — every claim, every question, every policy change is either building loyalty or eroding it.

### Part A: The Service Trust Test Walk-Through

**Tell the agency owner:**

"You're now a client of your own agency. You've been with them for 8 months. Walk through these scenarios as yourself — a real person who's paying premiums every month and hoping they made the right choice. At every point, ask yourself: **Do I trust this company? Would I stay?**"

**1. The routine question:**
- You need to add a vehicle to your policy. You call the agency. What happens? Who answers? Do you have to explain who you are and what you need from scratch? How long until it's done?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**2. The urgent request:**
- It's Friday at 4:30 PM. You just realized your insurance card expired and you need proof of coverage for a closing on Monday. What do you do? Who do you call? Does anyone answer?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**3. The billing confusion:**
- Your premium went up $40/month and nobody told you why. You call. Can the person who answers explain it, or do they say "let me find out and call you back"? Do they actually call back?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**4. The claim:**
- You had a fender bender. You're rattled, standing on the side of the road. You call your agent. Does someone answer? Do they walk you through what to do, or hand you a carrier 800 number? Do they follow up the next day to check on you?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**5. The major claim:**
- Your basement flooded. It's 10 PM. Water everywhere. You need help NOW. What happens when you call? Is there an after-hours process? Does your agent reach out the next morning without you having to chase them? Over the next 3 weeks of the claims process, how many times does your agent proactively check in?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**6. The coverage gap discovery:**
- Six months after buying your policy, you find out you don't have coverage for something you assumed was covered. Did anyone explain this during onboarding? Did anyone do a coverage review? Or did you just get a PDF and an ID card?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**7. The silence:**
- It's been 6 months. You haven't heard from your agency. Not a call, not an email, not a text. Nothing. A mailer from another agent lands in your mailbox offering a free coverage review. What do you do?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

**8. The referral test:**
- Your neighbor asks who you use for insurance. What would you actually say? Would you recommend your own agency enthusiastically, or say "they're fine, I guess"? What would it take for you to be a raving fan?
- Do I trust this company? Would I stay?

### Part B: The Service Role-Play — I'm Your CSR, You're the Client

**Tell the agency owner:**

"Now I'm going to play your CSR. You be the client. We're going to walk through real service scenarios using how your team actually handles them. React honestly."

**Scenario 1: The Inbound Service Call**
- Answer the phone the way your team answers. Use the same greeting. Ask the same questions.
- After: "Did that feel like calling a company that knows me? Or calling a call center? Did I feel valued, or like a policy number?"

**Scenario 2: The Hold & Transfer**
- The client calls with a question. The person who answers doesn't handle that type of request. Walk through the transfer.
- After: "How many times did I have to explain my situation? Did anyone apologize for the transfer? Did it feel seamless or frustrating?"

**Scenario 3: The Waiting Game**
- You told the client "I'll get back to you." It's been 2 days. No call back.
- Push: "Now you call back. How does the team handle it? Do they know what you called about last time, or do you start over?"

**Scenario 4: The Claim Handoff**
- Walk through how the team handles a new claim. From the first call to the handoff to the carrier.
- After: "At any point during this, did the client feel alone? Was there a moment where they didn't know what was happening or what to do next?"

**Scenario 5: The Proactive Touch**
- Role-play a proactive mid-term check-in call. Use whatever your team actually says — or admit that these calls don't happen.
- After: "If your team doesn't do these, what does the client hear from you between sale and renewal? If the answer is 'nothing,' what does that tell the client about how much you value the relationship?"

### The Service Truth

Most agency owners discover that their service experience is reactive, not proactive. Clients only hear from them when there's a problem or a bill. That's not a relationship — that's a transaction. And transactional relationships are vulnerable to anyone who offers a better price.

**Every service gap identified here becomes a pipeline stage, an automation, or a task in the Service Pipeline buildout.**

---

## Section 15: The Renewal Pipeline Deep-Dive — Are You Earning the Right to Keep Them?

Renewals aren't automatic. Every renewal is a decision the client makes — often without telling you they're making it. By the time they call to say "I'm leaving," they already left weeks ago. The renewal process either prevents that moment or causes it.

### Part A: The Renewal Trust Test Walk-Through

**Tell the agency owner:**

"You're a client whose policy renews in 90 days. Walk through what happens between now and renewal day. At every point, ask yourself: **Do I trust this company? Would I renew?**"

**1. The 90-day mark:**
- What happens at 90 days before renewal? Does anyone at the agency know your renewal is coming? Do YOU know? Has anyone reached out?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**2. The rate increase notification:**
- Your premium is going up 18%. How do you find out? A letter from the carrier? A call from your agent? Or just a higher bill?
- If nobody calls you to explain, what do you feel? Betrayed? Ignored? Like nobody's fighting for you?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**3. The remarketing (or lack of it):**
- Did your agent shop your renewal with other carriers? Do you know? Did they tell you? Or did they just let the renewal go through at the higher rate?
- If they DID remarket, did they explain what they found? Did they present options? Or just say "this is the best we could do"?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**4. The renewal presentation:**
- How was your renewal presented? A phone call explaining your options? An email with attachments? Nothing — just auto-renewal?
- Did anyone review your coverage to make sure it still fits your life? You added a pool last year. You have a teenager driving now. Did anyone ask?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**5. The competitor offer:**
- It's 30 days before renewal. You got a mailer from a competing agent: "Free coverage review — most people are overpaying." Your current agent hasn't called. What do you do?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**6. The shopping client:**
- You called another agent. They quoted you $200/year less. Now you call your current agent to tell them you're shopping. What happens? Do they fight for you? Remarket immediately? Just say "sorry to hear that"?
- Do I trust this company? Would I renew?

**7. The win-back (or lack of it):**
- You left. You went to the other agent. Does your old agency reach out at all? When? What do they say? Or is it just... silence?
- 6 months later, you're unhappy with the new agent. Would you go back? Would you even remember the old agency's name?
- Do I trust this company? Would I come back?

### Part B: The Renewal Role-Play — I'm Your Account Manager, You're the Renewing Client

**Tell the agency owner:**

"I'm going to play your account manager. You're the client. Your renewal is coming up. Let's walk through it the way your team actually handles it."

**Scenario 1: The Proactive Renewal Call (or the Absence of One)**
- Make the renewal call the way your team does it. If your team doesn't make proactive renewal calls, sit in silence for 10 seconds. That's what your client hears.
- After: "If that was the only communication I got before my renewal, would I feel valued? Or would I feel like just another policy number?"

**Scenario 2: The Rate Increase Conversation**
- Deliver the news: "Your premium is going up 15%." Use the same words your team uses.
- After: "Did that explanation make me feel like you fought for me? Or like you're just the messenger for bad news?"
- Push: "Now do it the right way. Call me 60 days out. Explain what's happening in the market. Tell me what you've already done to shop for better rates. Show me options. Feel the difference?"

**Scenario 3: The Coverage Review**
- Conduct a renewal review the way your team does. Ask the questions they ask. Cover what they cover.
- After: "Did you ask about changes in my life? New car? New home project? Kid turned 16? Or did you just confirm the address is the same?"
- Push: "What if I had a trampoline I never told you about? An in-home business? A tenant in my basement? Would your review have caught those? Because if it didn't, and there's a claim, that's on the agency."

**Scenario 4: The "I'm Shopping" Call**
- As the client, say: "I just want to let you know, I've been getting some quotes from other agents."
- Watch how the agency owner responds. Do they panic? Get defensive? Ask questions? Offer to remarket?
- After: "Did your response make me feel like you care about keeping me? Or like you already gave up?"

**Scenario 5: The Lost Client**
- The client left. It's been 60 days. Call them to try to win them back — using whatever process your team has. If there is no process, sit in silence.
- After: "Every client who leaves represents X years of future premium revenue. What's the cost of NOT having a win-back process? How many clients have you lost in the last year that you never tried to bring back?"

### The Renewal Truth

Retention is not about price. It's about whether the client FEELS like their agent is working for them. Agencies that proactively review, proactively communicate, and proactively fight for their clients renew at 92-95%. Agencies that auto-renew and hope for the best renew at 80-85%. That 10% gap, applied to a 1,000-policy agency, is 100 lost clients a year — and 3-5 years of premium revenue PER client walking out the door.

**Every renewal gap identified here becomes a pipeline stage, an automation, or a task in the Renewal Pipeline buildout.**

## Section 16: Setting the Right Expectations About AgencyZoom

This section is NOT optional. Before you build anything, the agency owner needs to understand what AgencyZoom IS and what it ISN'T. Misaligned expectations kill adoption.

### What AgencyZoom IS:

**AgencyZoom is one of the best sales and service tools built specifically for insurance agencies.** It does what it does extremely well:

- **Sales pipeline management** — Track leads from first contact to bound policy with visibility and accountability
- **Lifecycle automation** — Automated emails, texts, tasks, and reminders triggered by pipeline stage changes
- **Content library** — Pre-built and custom templates for every touchpoint
- **Producer and team dashboards** — Real-time visibility into who's doing what
- **Service tracking** — Claims, endorsements, and service requests with workflow stages
- **Renewal management** — Proactive renewal pipelines with automated outreach
- **Smart Cycle** — Automated recycling of unsold leads back into the funnel
- **Activity tracking** — Every call, email, text, and task logged for accountability

### What AgencyZoom is NOT:

**AgencyZoom is not a full CRM in the Salesforce/HubSpot sense.** And it doesn't need to be. Agencies that expect it to be everything get frustrated. Agencies that understand what it's built for fall in love with it.

Specifically:
- **It's not your AMS.** It doesn't replace AMS360, Hawksoft, NowCerts, or QQCatalyst. It integrates WITH them. Your AMS is your system of record. AgencyZoom is your system of action.
- **It's not a marketing platform.** It doesn't do mass email campaigns, social media management, or SEO. Use Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or a dedicated marketing tool for that. AgencyZoom handles 1-to-1 and automated lifecycle communication.
- **It's not a phone system.** It doesn't replace your VoIP or phone setup. It logs calls and triggers follow-ups.
- **It's not a document management system.** It tracks workflows around documents, but your AMS stores the actual policies and documents.

### The Right Frame:

**Think of AgencyZoom as the ACTION layer that sits on top of your AMS.** Your AMS stores the data. AgencyZoom tells your team what to DO with that data — and when to do it.

When this is understood correctly:
- Producers stop complaining that "it doesn't do X" and start using the pipeline and automation tools that make them money
- CSRs stop trying to use it as a document management system and start using the service pipelines that keep clients happy
- Owners stop comparing it to Salesforce and start comparing their close rates before and after

**This framing should be established in the very first conversation with the agency.** If they walk into the buildout thinking AgencyZoom is a full CRM, they'll be disappointed no matter how good the buildout is. If they understand it's a purpose-built sales and service engine for insurance agencies, they'll see its value immediately.

## After the Full Interview — Action Plan

1. **Identify the top 3-5 gaps** — places where leads fall through, processes break down, or the CX/EX is weak
2. **Map the ACTUAL sales process** — not the ideal one, the real one as described in the interview
3. **Compare actual vs. ideal** — use the pipeline blueprints in `pipeline-blueprints.md` as the target
4. **Prioritize the buildout** — fix the biggest revenue leaks first, not the easiest things
5. **Build the BrandScript** — use the answers from Section 11 and 12 to craft messaging that reflects what they actually do well
6. **Design automation that fills gaps** — every gap identified in the interview should have a corresponding automation step, task, or content piece in the buildout
7. **Create the content plan** — the questions prospects ask (revealed in the interview) become the Trust and Grow content strategy

**The interview IS the buildout.** Everything that comes after is just implementing what the interview revealed.
